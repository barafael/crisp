# CRisp: C and Rust implementations of a simple lisp language
Following the book ["Build Your Own Lisp"](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/) by Daniel Holden.

This book describes writing a C implementation of a simple lisp-like language. The C implementation from the book is eventually going to be in [crisp/cisp](https://github.com/medium-endian/crisp/tree/master/cisp).

In [crisp/rusp](https://github.com/medium-endian/crisp/tree/master/cisp), I will try to get a similar program going, using the same parser generator and syntax as in the book, but written in Rust.
